# Evaluation

In Metaworld, agents are to be evaluated using their **success rate** on a set of tasks and goal positions, not the episodic reward achieved during training.

Each environment computes a success flag which is available through the `info` dictionary's `"success"` key, which is `0` when the task has not yet been accomplished, and `1` when success has been achieved.

To aid in easier evaluation of agents, the benchmark provides two evaluation utility functions through the `metaworld.evaluation` package, one for multi-task reinforcement learning and one for meta-reinforcement learning respectively.

## Methodology

Specifically, success rate is measured in the following way for each benchmark:

### Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (MT1, MT10, MT50)

The agent, trained on the set of training tasks and training goal positions from the benchmark, is evaluated for one episode per training goal position, per training task. Meaning it is in practice evaluated for 50 episodes (one for each of the 50 goals) for each training task, and these goal positions are the same ones seen during training. During this episode, the agent is considered to have succeeded if the success flag is `1` *at any point during the episode*, not just at the end of the episode.

The final metric is the average success rate achieved across all tasks and episodes.

Here is python pseudocode for this procedure:

```python
def multi_task_eval(agent, envs, num_evaluation_episodes = 50, episode_horizon = 500):
   success_rate = 0.0

   for episode in range(num_evaluation_episodes):
      envs.iterate_goal_position()
      obs = envs.reset()
      for env in envs:
         obs = env.reset()
         for step in range(episode_horizon):
            action, _ = agent.eval_action(obs)
            next_obs, _, _, _, info = env.step(action)
            obs = next_obs

            if info["success"] == 1:
               success_rate += 1
               break

   success_rate /= (num_evaluation_episodes * envs.num_envs)

   return success_rate
```

### Meta-Reinforcement Learning (ML1, ML10, ML45)

The agent, trained on the set of training tasks and training goal positions from the benchmark, is evaluated for three episodes per *testing goal position*, *per testing task*. In ML1, the task is the same between training and testing, but the set of goal positions is different and not seen during training. For ML10 and ML45, there are 5 held out testing tasks which are different from the training tasks, and each of them also has 40 goal positions never seen during training.

However, since meta-RL is all about adaptation, additionally the evaluation procedure also allows the agent to adapt. Specifically, one would collect `adaptation_steps * adaptation_episodes` number of episodes per testing task, per testing goal, and give them back to the network to adapt from, before computing the final post-adaptation evaluation metric (in three episodes) for that testing goal / task, in a similar fashion to the multi-task reinforcement learning setting. In practice, for each adaptation step, `adaptation_episodes` number of episodes is collected per testing goal and given back to the network to adapt from as a batch of rollouts, so the agent can iteratively adapt.

The agent can either adapt continuously each timestep (e.g. sequence-model based metalearners), or each adaptation step (e.g. gradient-based metalearners), or both.

Success is measured during each episode for each goal the same way as it in the multi-task setting: the agent is considered to have succeeded if the success flag is `1` at any point during the episode. And the final metric is likewise still the average success rate across all testing tasks and episodes.

Here is python pseudocode for this procedure:

```python
def metalearning_eval(agent, eval_envs, adaptation_steps = 1, adaptation_episodes = 10, num_evals = 40, episode_horizon):
   success_rate = 0.0
   initial_obs = eval_envs.reset()

   for goal in range(num_evals):
      eval_envs.iterate_goal_position()
      agent.init()

      for step in range(adaptation_steps):
         for _ in range(adaptation_episodes):
            obs = eval_envs.reset()
            for _ in range(episode_horizon):
               action, misc_outs = agent.adapt_action(obs)
               next_obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = eval_envs.step(action)
               agent.step(obs, action, reward, terminated, truncated, next_obs, misc_outs)

         agent.adapt()

      success_rate += multi_task_eval(adaptive_agent, eval_envs, num_evaluation_episodes=3)

   success_rate /= num_evals

   return success_rate
```

#### The `num_evals` parameter, and meta batch size in Metaworld
The pseudocode assumes a meta batch size of 1 and 40 total tasks to go through (`num_evals`). For example this could work for ML1 with 40 test goals. In practice, meta batch size would be higher, e.g. 20, and the value of `num_evals` becomes a bit less intuitive.

In meta-reinforcement learning, we typically use a vectorised environment where each environment instance is assigned to a given task. The number of tasks we are processing in parallel at a given iteration is known as the **meta batch size**. In typical meta-reinforcement learning where we just have parametric task variations, the vector that specifies the variation is the task. In Metaworld, things are a little more complicated. We have both distinct tasks (e.g. `reach-v3` or `sweep-into-v3`) and different goal positions within each task. The task space in Metaworld is considered to be the combinatorial space of tasks and goal positions.

For ML10 and ML45, we have 5 test tasks, each of which has 40 test goal positions. We can therefore use a meta batch size of 20, and create 4 instances of each task within the vectorised environment for this meta batch, each of which will have 10 distinct goal positions. Therefore, to iterate over all `(task,goal)` combinations during evaluation, we would need `num_evals=10`.

For ML1, `num_evals` would depend on the meta batch size. We can either have a meta batch size of 1 (in which case `num_evals` would be 40), or a meta batch size of 20 (in which case `num_evals` would be 2).

> [!NOTE]
> The meta batch sizes and num evals values are suggestions and can be thought of as worked out examples to explain the evaluation logic. Feel free to use different values, as long as all `(task,goal)` combinations are covered during evaluation.

## Utility functions

To avoid the need to implement the evaluation procedure from scratch, implementations for both the multi-task and meta-reinforcement learning evaluation procedures can be found in the `metaworld.evaluation` package under the functions `evaluation` and `metalearning_evaluation` respectively.

### The `Agent` / `MetaLearningAgent` protocols

The evaluation utilities are agnostic to your agent's architecture and implementation framework, but in their signature they both expect an object that adheres to a given protocol as the first argument (`agent`).

Specifically, this is the protocol each evaluation function respectively expects:

```python
class Agent(Protocol):
    def eval_action(
        self, observations: npt.NDArray[np.float64]
    ) -> npt.NDArray[np.float64]: ...

    def reset(self, env_mask: npt.NDArray[np.bool_]) -> None: ...


class MetaLearningAgent(Agent):
    def init(self) -> None: ...

    def adapt_action(
        self, observations: npt.NDArray[np.float64]
    ) -> tuple[npt.NDArray[np.float64], dict[str, npt.NDArray]]: ...

    def step(self, timestep: Timestep) -> None: ...

    def adapt(self) -> None: ...
```

For both multi-task and meta-reinforcement learning evaluations, the `Agent` object should have a `eval_action` method that takes in a numpy array of some observations and outputs actions. One should think of this as the action the agent takes when it is being evaluated and therefore this should probably be deterministic. It should also have a `reset` method that resets the agent state for individual envs that have terminated. The method can be empty if the agent is stateless, but it should still be present on the `Agent` object.

For meta-reinforcement learning, an agent should have the following additional methods implemented:
- `init()`: re-initialises the agent for adaptation. This method resets the agent back to the pre-adaptation state.
- `adapt_action(observations: npt.NDArray[np.float64]) -> tuple[npt.NDArray[np.float64], dict[str, npt.NDArray]]`: takes in observations from the vectorised evaluation environment and outputs a tuple of actions and miscellaneous policy outputs that might be needed during adaptation.
- `step(timestep: Timestep)`: takes in a `Timestep`, which contains data from the current transitions, and handles any logic that ingests this data for adaptation (e.g. storing in a buffer, advancing RNN state, etc.)
- `adapt()`: a method called at the end of each adaptation step. The agent can use this as a signal to process the experience ingested through `step()`, (e.g. gradient update from stored experience in MAML).

The `Timestep` named tuple that the agent will be given at each adaptation timestep looks like so:
```python
class Timestep(NamedTuple):
    observation: npt.NDArray
    action: npt.NDArray
    reward: npt.NDArray
    terminated: npt.NDArray
    truncated: npt.NDArray
    aux_policy_outputs: dict[str, npt.NDArray]
```

### Utility outputs

The evaluation utilities output multiple items, not just the overall success rate. Specifically, they return a tuple of three items:
- `mean_success_rate`: the aforementioned success rate. This is a float scalar.
- `mean_returns`: the returns achieved during evaluation averaged across all goal positions / tasks. This is a float scalar.
- `success_rate_per_task`: the success rate achieved for each task evaluated. This is a dictionary keyed by the task name as a string and a float scalar as a value. This scalar is the success rate averaged across goal positions for the given task.
- `returns_per_task`: the returns achieved for each task evaluated. This is a dictionary keyed by the task name as a string and a float scalar as a value. This scalar is the returns averaged across goal positions for the given task.

### Other assumptions

The evaluation utilities assume that you have instantiated the environments required using `gym.make`. If not, then these are the implicit assumptions for the `envs` / `eval_envs` provided into the utilities:
- The object is `SyncVectorEnv` or `AsyncVectorEnv`.
- Each sub-env has the following wrappers:
  - `metaworld.wrappers.RandomTaskSelectWrapper` or `metaworld.wrappers.PseudoRandomTaskSelectWrapper`, which have been initialised with the correct set of tasks.
  - `metaworld.wrappers.AutoTerminateOnSuccessWrapper`.
